# QR Bill Reader

Web app that can read QR codes on austrian bills, containing info about paid prices etc.

The app is hosted [here](https://qrrechnung.at/), but you can also run it yourself if you want to.

Some more info about what you can do with the app and how to use it can be found on the [About-page](https://qrrechnung.at/about).

The app is available in German and English (your browser should be able to figure out, which of the two you might prefer)


## Building/running yourself

The project is built with Create React App, therefore the standard scripts are available.

- `npm start` to start the application locally
- `npm run build` to make a build, that can be hosted as a static site with e.g. nginx
